## Coding Tools Selection

- Regularly assess the tools and technologies used by your team.
- Standardize tools across teams when possible to improve collaboration and reduce overhead.
- Consider both open-source and commercial options, weighing cost against features and support.

## CICD Tools Selection

A well-designed CICD pipeline is crucial for engineering productivity and code quality. Key considerations include:

### Pipeline Speed and Efficiency
- Optimize build and test execution time - aim for under 10 minutes for basic validation
- Implement parallel execution where possible
- Cache dependencies and build artifacts
- Enable incremental builds
- Monitor pipeline metrics and optimize bottlenecks

### Quality Gates
- Static code analysis and linting
- Unit test coverage requirements (typically 70-80% minimum)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency analysis and updates
- Performance testing thresholds
- Code review requirements

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Fast, isolated tests run on every commit
- Integration tests: Verify component interactions
- End-to-end tests: Full system validation
- Load/performance tests: For critical paths
- Security tests: Regular security scanning

### Environment Management
- Reproducible development environments
- Staging environments that mirror production
- Feature branch environments for testing
- Clean environment creation and teardown
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for environment definitions

### Deployment Safety
- Feature flags for controlled rollouts
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Blue-green or canary deployment options
- Production verification tests
- Automated smoke tests post-deployment

### Monitoring and Observability
- Pipeline health metrics
- Build success/failure rates
- Test coverage trends
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

### Developer Experience
- Clear error messages and failure notifications
- Self-service tools for common tasks
- Local development environment parity
- Easy access to logs and debugging tools
- Documentation for pipeline maintenance

### Security and Compliance
- Secrets management
- Access control and audit logs
- Compliance checks integration
- Artifact signing and verification
- Container image scanning
