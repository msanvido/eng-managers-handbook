# What is Management

What all managers have in common is our commitment to helping their direct reports to:

* Have great impact and deliver great results  
* learn and grow  
* feel engaged, safe and happy in their work

Managers are leaders (Remember the phrase: “YOU LEAD PEOPLE but MANAGE THINGS”) that:

* **Coaches:** We ask questions that help our direct reports think more strategically. We empower them to find solutions to their own problems.  
* **Role Models:** We set the climate for our team. Direct reports will model a manager’s habits, moods, and values. Great managers use this power for good.  
* **Multipliers First, Doers Second:** While individual contributors are successful when *they* get results, managers are successful when *each of their reports* (and our entire team) gets results.  
* **Cheerleaders:** for the team and the team accomplishments.

Sometime people assume that to achieve the above they need to be liked, but this is not true. Sometimes the right decision are not the most popular and often a decision will make somebody in your team unhappy. Navigating this is a skill that is developed over time but requires 2 things: Respect and Consistency.

Consistency meaning: cleary define who (usally you or the team leader) is the ultimate decision maker in the decision making process.
Respect: that the team understand that you have the necessary authority and udnerstanding to make the decision and that you will be held accountable for the decision.


Successful engineering managers embody the following qualities:

- **Empathy**: Understanding and relating to team members' feelings and perspectives.
- **Adaptability**: Flexibly adjusting management style to suit different situations and individuals.
- **Vision**: Providing clear direction and aligning team efforts with company goals.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining high ethical standards and building trust within the team.

See [**servant leadership**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant\_leadership) style model of management.

> Happy and engaged engineers will build great products that ultimately create happy and loyal customers.


Management can be divided into three equally important responsibilities: People, Projects, and Resources (money, tools, and time). We will go over each of these in the following sections.
