# What is Management

What all managers have in common is our commitment to helping their direct reports to:

* Have great impact and deliver great results  
* learn and grow  
* feel engaged, safe and happy in their work

Managers are leaders (Remember the phrase: **YOU LEAD PEOPLE but MANAGE THINGS**) that:

* **Coaches:** We ask questions that help our direct reports think more strategically. We empower them to find solutions to their own problems.  
* **Role Models:** We set the climate for our team. Direct reports will model a managerâ€™s habits, moods, and values. Great managers use this power for good.  
* **Multipliers First, Doers Second:** While individual contributors are successful when *they* get results, managers are successful when *each of their reports* (and the entire team) gets results.  
* **Cheerleaders:** for the team and the team accomplishments.

Sometime people assume that to achieve the above they need to be liked, but this is not true. Sometimes the right decision are not the most popular and often a decision will make somebody in your team unhappy. Navigating this is a skill that is developed over time but requires 2 things: Respect and Consistency.

Consistency meaning: clearly define who (usually you or the team leader) is the ultimate decision maker in the decision making process.
Respect: that the team understand that you have the necessary authority and understanding to make the decision and that you will be held accountable for the decision.

There are some frameworks that can help (like RACI -- /todo Reference) but the most important thing is to be consistent ad build enough respect to support you decisions.

Successful engineering managers embody the following qualities:

- **Empathy**: Understanding and relating to team members' feelings and perspectives.
- **Adaptability**: Flexibly adjusting management style to suit different situations and individuals.
- **Vision**: Providing clear direction and aligning team efforts with company goals.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining high ethical standards and building trust within the team.

See [**servant leadership**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant\_leadership) style model of management.

## The Management trap
Something I've observed is that as you become more senior, you'll find slowly move further and further away from the real work. This is not necessarily a bad thing, and a necessity but in the long term can be detrimental to your effectiveness since you you will slowly lose the the skills and intuitions needed to effectively manager an engineering organization, manager your skill at doing the work yourself, the opportunity to practice that skill, and the gratification of doing so that drew you to your chosen profession in the first place. And you'll probably also get worse at being a manager as you lose touch with the actual work.

Avoiding *managerdom* is hard, but this are few things that helped me keep the balance to "staying in the trenches":

- Take small, non-critical projects: Work on unit tests, library upgrades, etc. This keeps skills fresh and provides insight into engineers' daily challenges.
- Participate in code reviews: Stay updated on architecture and implementation approaches.
- Be an "Eagle Eye": Observe actively and assist team members when they struggle, maintaining technical skills while building trust.

These strategies have helped me immensely keep my skills current and imposter syndrome in check.
Obviously there are other ways to stay in the trenches, but these are the ones that worked for me.

Note: I think this is only tangentially related to Founder Mode vs Manager Mode. It's much more related to another Paul Graham essay, Maker's Schedule vs Manager's Schedule. And Deep Work by Cal Newport is very relevant.

> Happy and engaged engineers will build great products that ultimately create happy and loyal customers.


Management can be divided into three equally important responsibilities: People, Projects, and Resources (money, tools, and time). We will go over each of these in the following sections.
