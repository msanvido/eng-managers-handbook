# What is Management

What all managers have in common is our commitment to helping their direct reports to:

* Have great impact and deliver great results  
* learn and grow  
* feel engaged, safe and happy in their work

Managers are leaders (Remember the phrase: **YOU LEAD PEOPLE but MANAGE THINGS**) that:

* **Coaches:** We ask questions that help our direct reports think more strategically. We empower them to find solutions to their own problems.  
* **Role Models:** We set the climate for our team. Direct reports will model a manager’s habits, moods, and values. Great managers use this power for good.  
* **Multipliers First, Doers Second:** While individual contributors are successful when *they* get results, managers are successful when *each of their reports* (and the entire team) gets results.  
* **Cheerleaders:** for the team and the team accomplishments.

Sometime people assume that to achieve the above they need to be liked, but this is not true. Sometimes the right decision are not the most popular and often a decision will make somebody in your team unhappy. Navigating this is a skill that is developed over time but requires 2 things: Respect and Consistency.

Consistency meaning: clearly define who (usually you or the team leader) is the ultimate decision maker in the decision making process.
Respect: that the team understand that you have the necessary authority and understanding to make the decision and that you will be held accountable for the decision.

There are some frameworks that can help (like RACI -- /todo Reference) but the most important thing is to be consistent ad build enough respect to support you decisions.

Successful engineering managers embody the following qualities:

- **Empathy**: Understanding and relating to team members' feelings and perspectives.
- **Adaptability**: Flexibly adjusting management style to suit different situations and individuals.
- **Vision**: Providing clear direction and aligning team efforts with company goals.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining high ethical standards and building trust within the team.

## Leadership Styles
There are numerous leadership styles, each offering a unique approach to guiding and inspiring people. While I have outlined some of the most common styles here, the key to successful leadership lies in authenticity. Adopting a leadership style that does not resonate with your true self is unlikely to yield positive results. Authenticity builds trust and credibility, which are essential for effective leadership.

In addition to authenticity, successful leadership requires three critical elements:

1. **Consistency**: Your actions and decisions should align with your stated values and principles. Inconsistencies can erode trust and create confusion within the team.
2. **Fairness**: Treat everyone equitably, ensuring that decisions are impartial and based on merit. Fairness fosters respect and loyalty among team members.
3. **Openness to Feedback**: Encourage and actively listen to feedback from your team. Being receptive to input not only improves your leadership but also demonstrates humility and a willingness to grow.

Without these foundational qualities, even the most well-defined leadership style may fail to inspire and motivate others. Leadership is not just about directing; it is about earning the trust and commitment of those you lead.

- **Autocratic (Authoritarian)** – The leader makes decisions unilaterally and expects strict compliance, valuing speed and control over participation.  
- **Benevolent Dictator** – One person retains full authority but tempers it with genuine concern for followers’ welfare, guiding firmly yet protectively.  
- **Democratic (Participative)** – Decisions are made with substantial input from the team, fostering engagement and shared ownership of outcomes.  
- **Laissez-Faire** – The leader provides minimal direction, giving team members maximum autonomy to define goals and methods.  
- **Servant Leadership** – The leader prioritizes serving the needs and growth of the team, believing results flow from empowered people.  
- **Transformational** – Inspires followers with a compelling vision and energizes change through charisma, enthusiasm, and high expectations.  
- **Transactional** – Relies on clear structures of rewards and penalties, focusing on performance against defined objectives.  
- **Charismatic** – Uses personal magnetism and emotional appeal to rally commitment and drive momentum toward the leader’s goals.  
- **Visionary** – Paints a clear, future-oriented picture and aligns people by connecting their work to that larger purpose.  
- **Coaching** – Develops individuals through guidance, feedback, and tailored challenges, seeing every task as a learning opportunity.  
- **Pacesetting** – Leads by example with intense speed and high standards, expecting others to keep up and deliver quickly.  
- **Situational** – Adapts style (directive, supportive, delegating, coaching) to followers’ readiness and the specific context.  
- **Bureaucratic** – Emphasizes strict adherence to rules, procedures, and hierarchies to ensure consistency and risk control.  

I my personal exprience, startnad and smaller teams work well with servant leadershipo approach, given you are trying to grow the team and the product at a very fast pace, and this can only be achieved if you serve your team and let them execute in autonomy.
Note: that one trap of the servant leadership style is that there is a tendency to step in to help when needed. You should not take over and fix the issue but rather help fix the issue: i.e. avoid the “don’t worry I’ll take care of it”

See [**servant leadership**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant\_leadership) style model of management.

## The Management trap
Something I've observed is that as you become more senior, you'll find slowly move further and further away from the real work. This is not necessarily a bad thing, and a necessity but in the long term can be detrimental to your effectiveness since you you will slowly lose the the skills and intuitions needed to effectively manager an engineering organization, manager your skill at doing the work yourself, the opportunity to practice that skill, and the gratification of doing so that drew you to your chosen profession in the first place. And you'll probably also get worse at being a manager as you lose touch with the actual work.

Avoiding *managerdom* is hard, but this are few things that helped me keep the balance to "staying in the trenches":

- Take small, non-critical projects: Work on unit tests, library upgrades, etc. This keeps skills fresh and provides insight into engineers' daily challenges.
- Participate in code reviews: Stay updated on architecture and implementation approaches.
- Be an "Eagle Eye": Observe actively and assist team members when they struggle, maintaining technical skills while building trust.

These strategies have helped me immensely keep my skills current and imposter syndrome in check.
Obviously there are other ways to stay in the trenches, but these are the ones that worked for me.

Note: I think this is only tangentially related to Founder Mode vs Manager Mode. It's much more related to another Paul Graham essay, Maker's Schedule vs Manager's Schedule. And Deep Work by Cal Newport is very relevant.

> Happy and engaged engineers will build great products that ultimately create happy and loyal customers.


Management can be divided into three equally important responsibilities: People, Projects, and Resources (money, tools, and time). We will go over each of these in the following sections.
