# People Management

{: .note-title }
> Personal Note
> * People management goes further than company needs. People will come and leave the company,
> but will always remember how they have been managed. Remember that one day they might even
> hire you — or more likely asked for a backdoor reference.  
> * You cannot make everybody happy\! This is probably the hardest part of the manager's job,
> but do not optimize on maximizing people's happiness, maximize for outcomes.  
> * You mostly will hear negative feedback, and sometimes it is hard to stay positive.
> Remember you are the cheerleader for the org, people look at you for how you respond to negative
> feedback. If you find the negativity overwhelming work with your leader/HR team to address the negativity.

## Goals

Your most important goal is to set up each engineer for success and have maximal impact to the team and company.
So it is very important you clearly align with the team and engineer on what the goals are.

Now let the magic happen, you hired smart people and let them do what they are best at! Now is the time to monitor and be proactive. 

Like you monitor software systems you need to keep an eye on how things are progressing, and scale things up and down based as needed, etc.

Here a short list of things you could do:

* Distribute workload to the team members evenly and based on know-how, capabilities, and interests of the engineer.  
* Give growth opportunities (e.g. lead a project, pair with a senior eng to accelerate their progress, organize training and lunch & learns, etc)  
* Monitor engineering performance (contributions) and change/assign workload accordingly  
* Monitor/Approve vacation/WFH/WFR: This is not to be a spy but you are responsible for you employees and hence you should know where they are:  
  * Important for planning purposes  
  * In case of emergencies (accidents, earthquakes, etc)  
  * In case of urgent requests (customer requests)  
* Support the need of each engineer: Different types of engineers need different support (4 types: insecure, knowledgeable, bored, disengaged)

## Building a Strength Map
Like you do when driving somewhere you need a map and a directions how to get there.
Similarly when you are responsible for a team and product you need to know where you are going and how to get there.
This should be your starting point, and likely the first thing you do when you join a team. Understand you team capabilities: who would be very hard to do any planning (both projects, and people)

What is a strength and weaknesses map for each individual engineer and collaborator:
- What is this engineers strength
- What is the know-how and level of expertise 
- What are the weaknesses and areas of improvement
- And ultimately how much you can lean on them

This strength map is going to help you both in assign projects, teams as well as a starting point for performance reviews.
Note that this is you opinion and you should continuously validate and confirm the strength map with your with external sources (either on 1:1, or skip-levels or even with people outside of the company)

## Building Relationships and Team Dynamics

People are not Machines hence building a personal relationships is vital to create a high performing environment.
Is important to know what’s going on in their personal lives as well: In my experience this can only be learned by building a good personal relationship with each employee.

Interpersonal dynamics with other teammates or customers: listen/watch carefully to how people interact. This is very difficult to do in a remote setting.  

## Balancing Workload

- Assign tasks based on team member's strengths and interests.
- Monitor and adjust workload based on team member's performance.
- Encourage team members to take on additional responsibilities.
- Try to create team continuity in projects, there is a non-trivial cost in context-switching.

Energizing and de-energizing work: unfortunately there is some work that needs to be done that might be found de-energizing to some. Important is to balance is and distribute the de-energizing work across the team in a fair way. Some people might not be vocal about it, hence is important to monitor the individual energy and productivity. Sadly the squeaky wheel is usually getting the grease, and is your role to make sure that all the deserving wheels get the grease.

## Fostering a Growth Mindset

Encourage continuous learning and development within your team:

- Set up mentorship programs pairing junior and senior engineers.
- Allocate time and budget for learning and development activities.
- Celebrate learning achievements and knowledge sharing (Lunch and Learns, or external speakers series, etc)
- Setup a learning budget for your team.
- Conference attendance: this is usually seen as a reward so be sure to reward the right people.

## Managing Remote and Distributed Teams

As remote work becomes more common, consider these additional points:

- Establish clear communication channels and expectations for remote work.
- Use tools to facilitate virtual collaboration (e.g., Miro, Figma, Notion).
- Schedule regular virtual team-building activities to maintain team cohesion.
- Be mindful of time zones when scheduling meetings and setting deadlines.

## Team dynamics, cohesion, and inclusion:

* Create an environment where everybody feels part of the team and shares wins and losses (think sport’s team spirit). Foster collaboration: Competition across teams and team members might be fun but not healthy in the long run; **PLEASE foster collaboration instead**.  
* Monitor for “alpha” and “silent” engineers. Make sure everybody can share views, and nobody abuses them. Let the senior engineers speak last, always ask for input both in public and in private.  
* praise in public and in person, BUT criticize in private unless you want to make a point to the whole team.  
* **ZERO-TOLERANCE for any unacceptable behaviors (see** [company code of conduct](https://app.vanta.com/policies/code-of-conduct-bsi))\!: If we let any unacceptable behavior slide, it will set the bar for the whole company. Quickly react, stop it, and make sure people know you intervened and make sure you chain of management and HR are aware of it and decide any next steps (warnings, suspension, termination)  
* praise/highlight good behavior and lead by example

## Tools at your disposition

* Monitor (how you know how people are doing)  
  * Weekly sync-up with each engineer (see suggestions on how to structure 1:1)  
  * monitor PR review/scanning (see script to scrap PR from github)  
  * monitor commits (git-flame or similar tools)  
  * monitor linear/jira tickets completion (\#closed, speed of closing and creation)

  Remember as a manager these are no**t metrics you want to track** (e.g. n number of tickets close per spring) but only the “logs” helping you debug potential issues. If you track these metrics you set the incentives wrong, you care only about impact and that is not measured by the number of commits.

* Control: These are the tools at your disposition to make changes  
  * 1:1 Feedback (how to give feedback.. See radical candor, sandwich approach) but if you build trust and transparency with your reports it is much easier…   
  * Workload/deliverable assignments: Add more, remove work, make sure to assign tasks that can be accomplished: balance energizing vs de-energizing work. Be fair across the team and teams and avoid creating the “go-to-guy” syndrome.  
  * Non-tech assignments: these are mostly interrupts like customer support, doc-writing, etc.  
  * Suggest special day-off(s): if you notice burndown and somethings is not right (personal situations)  
  * Leave of absence (See HR regulations): for issues that linger for a while this is a good option.   
  * Vacation/Day offs (see company guidelines): Make sure they do not impact the wider team, and have a backup plan for critical components.  
  * Performance reviews (should be done regularly)  
    * Self-assessments, manager assessment, OKRs, and eng org raking  
    * Area leads feedback  
  * OKRs (or a way to highlight the company and team goals)  
    * Ideally quarterly: format TBD based on the new teams  
  * For new hires: create a 30-60-90 plan to help you and the new hire bootstrap inside the company (have a standard our 30-60-90 day plans format)  
  * Performance Bonuses / Spot Bonuses / Gifts for people that for above the call of duty (You need to setup a quarterly/yearly budget org-wide for this: prepare it ahead of time so you have it ready)  
  * Team events:  
    * Have a team budget (e.g. $100/Q/person) manager by the teams (for team dinners or swag… let the team decide how to allocate it)  
  * Reassignments (move to another team):  
    * sometimes people skill, or personal issues are better if we move people in inter teams  
  * Performance Improvement Plan (PIP): Last resort to get somebody back on track.  
    * You must be OK with **any** outcome  
    * It will impact your relationship moving forward.  
    * Setup clear expectation and outcomes  
    * Work with HR/team-lead to correctly put this plan in place  
    * Some companies do not believe in PIPs, and prefer to be direct and move to a separation. Personally I think PIPs are important not only for the employee but as a signal that the company cares about making people successful and did everything possible before moving to a separation. I have seen 80% failures (i.e. PIP did not work), but the 20% of successes created very loyal and improved employees.  
  * Separation  
    * This is the last resort\! There is no way back, and the blast radius’s moral impact is also to be considered.  
    * Make sure to manage the communication on the way out and don’t delegate the termination to HR.  
    * Make sure team members are also aware and have 1:1 with them during (or just after the separation)  
    * Employees should not be surprised, they should know they are not performing at the expected level and might be on their way out.  
  * Leveling and promotions:  
    * Startup and levels is a long discussion, leverage one of the many levels in the industry and “adapt” it for your company needs. Don’t build one just for your company… This is a tool you will need/use externally as well.  
    * When introducing levels? Honestly the later the better BUT it will come up: especially junior engineers will want a level to measure themselves against the senior engineers. Also if you have none and introduce one… be prepared for some unhappiness in the org.  
    * Make sure you have a fixed cadence for re-evaluate people's performances, comp and their contribution (See template on how to run a performance review)  
      

## Hiring

* Hiring plan by quarter
* Job descriptions and interview plans
* Hiring manger role and interviewers panel
  * References

### Giving Offers

Total comp discussion, vesting
Job description and responsibilities

### Understanding options and RSUs


## Attrition

* Regrettable: this is the worst… mgmt’s goal is to avoid this:  
  * Can we match the offer? Often this is a temporary solution since money is often not the root cause.  
* Non-regrettable: these are people we “gently” pushed out.  
  * Best solution for all (no blast radius); make sure it is amicable and well communicated to the team members.  
  * Be in control of the narrative.

Startup attrition and tenure at startups is likely in the 2-3 years range (need some more data), but startups that are doing well and growing are more in the 5-7 years. 

Note: Startup years are a bit like dog-years in corporate life: 1 year at a startup can feel like 7 years at a larger company since things move way faster and at an accelerated pace.

## Engineering Organization Structure

As organizations grow, deliberately choosing the right team structure becomes critical for enabling effective product delivery and maintaining engineering velocity. Each structure has specific advantages and disadvantages that make it suitable for different contexts.

### Common Team Organization Models

#### 1. Functional/Technology Teams

Teams organized around technical specialties or functional areas (frontend, backend, data, infrastructure, QA, etc.).

{% mermaid %}
graph TD;
    CTO[CTO/VP Engineering];
    FE[Frontend Lead];
    BE[Backend Lead];
    QA[QA Lead];
    DATA[Data Lead];
    INFRA[Infrastructure Lead];
    
    CTO --> FE;
    CTO --> BE;
    CTO --> QA;
    CTO --> DATA;
    CTO --> INFRA;
    
    FE --> FE1[FE Engineer 1];
    FE --> FE2[FE Engineer 2];
    FE --> FE3[FE Engineer 3];
    
    BE --> BE1[BE Engineer 1];
    BE --> BE2[BE Engineer 2];
    BE --> BE3[BE Engineer 3];
    
    QA --> QA1[QA Engineer 1];
    QA --> QA2[QA Engineer 2];
    
    DATA --> DATA1[Data Engineer 1];
    DATA --> DATA2[Data Engineer 2];
    
    INFRA --> INFRA1[Infra Engineer 1];
    INFRA --> INFRA2[Infra Engineer 2];
    
    subgraph Product Feature A;
        FE1 -.-> BE1 -.-> QA1 -.-> DATA1 -.-> INFRA1;
    end;
    
    subgraph Product Feature B;
        FE2 -.-> BE2 -.-> QA2 -.-> DATA2 -.-> INFRA2;
    end;
{% endmermaid %}

**Pros:**
* Promotes technical excellence and specialization
* Clear career paths within technical domains
* Easier knowledge sharing between specialists
* Consistent standards and practices within domains

**Cons:**
* Creates handoffs and dependencies between teams
* End-to-end ownership is challenging
* Can lead to silos and communication barriers
* Often results in slower delivery cycles
* Product features need coordination across multiple teams

**Best for:** Early-stage organizations with specialized technical needs or regulated environments requiring strict separation of concerns.

#### 2. Feature/Product Teams (Cross-functional)

Teams organized around product features or customer experiences with all necessary skills embedded.

{% mermaid %}
graph TD;
    HEAD[Head of Engineering];
    
    HEAD --> TEAM_A[Team A Lead<br>User Experience];
    HEAD --> TEAM_B[Team B Lead<br>Payments];
    HEAD --> TEAM_C[Team C Lead<br>Analytics];
    
    TEAM_A --> A_FE[Frontend Eng];
    TEAM_A --> A_BE[Backend Eng];
    TEAM_A --> A_QA[QA Eng];
    TEAM_A --> A_DEVOPS[DevOps Eng];
    TEAM_A --> A_PM[Product Manager];
    TEAM_A --> A_DESIGN[Designer];
    
    TEAM_B --> B_FE[Frontend Eng];
    TEAM_B --> B_BE[Backend Eng];
    TEAM_B --> B_QA[QA Eng];
    TEAM_B --> B_DEVOPS[DevOps Eng];
    TEAM_B --> B_PM[Product Manager];
    TEAM_B --> B_DESIGN[Designer];
    
    TEAM_C --> C_FE[Frontend Eng];
    TEAM_C --> C_BE[Backend Eng];
    TEAM_C --> C_QA[QA Eng];
    TEAM_C --> C_DEVOPS[DevOps Eng];
    TEAM_C --> C_PM[Product Manager];
    TEAM_C --> C_DATA[Data Scientist];
    
    subgraph Team A: User Experience;
        A_FE --- A_BE --- A_QA --- A_DEVOPS --- A_PM --- A_DESIGN;
    end;
    
    subgraph Team B: Payments;
        B_FE --- B_BE --- B_QA --- B_DEVOPS --- B_PM --- B_DESIGN;
    end;
    
    subgraph Team C: Analytics;
        C_FE --- C_BE --- C_QA --- C_DEVOPS --- C_PM --- C_DATA;
    end;
{% endmermaid %}

**Pros:**
* End-to-end ownership reduces handoffs
* Faster delivery and iteration cycles
* Better alignment with customer/business value
* Teams have autonomy to make decisions
* Promotes shared understanding of product goals

**Cons:**
* Technical standards may vary across teams
* Specialists might feel isolated from peers
* Can lead to duplicated work across teams
* Knowledge sharing requires deliberate effort
* May result in inconsistent architecture

**Best for:** Organizations focused on rapid product development and customer-facing features.

#### 3. Matrix Organization

Engineers belong to both functional teams (for standards/expertise) and product teams (for delivery).

{% mermaid %}
graph TD;
    CTO[CTO];
    VP_PRODUCT[VP of Product];
    
    CTO --> VP_TECH_FE[VP Frontend];

    class VP_PRODUCT,PROD_A,PROD_B,PROD_C product;
{% endmermaid %}

**Pros:**
* Balances technical excellence with product focus
* Provides community for specialists
* Enables consistent practices across product teams
* Supports knowledge sharing and career development

**Cons:**
* Dual reporting creates complexity and confusion
* Engineers may face competing priorities
* Requires more coordination and overhead
* Decision-making can be slower
* Performance management is more complex

**Best for:** Larger organizations needing both functional excellence and product focus.

#### 4. Team Topologies Model

A modern approach to team organization based on cognitive load and team interaction patterns.

    class ENABLING enabling;
    class CUSTOMER1,CUSTOMER2,CUSTOMER3 customer;
{% endmermaid %}

1. **Stream-aligned teams**: Focused on a specific product or service stream, delivering value directly to customers.
   * **Pros:** End-to-end ownership, customer focus, autonomy
   * **Cons:** May need significant platform support, risk of divergent practices

2. **Enabling teams**: Temporary teams that help stream-aligned teams overcome specific challenges.
   * **Pros:** Accelerates learning, shares best practices
   * **Cons:** Can create dependencies, risk of becoming permanent

3. **Complicated subsystem teams**: Handle complex components requiring specialized expertise.
   * **Pros:** Manages complexity, allows specialization
   * **Cons:** Can become a bottleneck, risk of creating critical dependencies

4. **Platform teams**: Build internal products that reduce cognitive load for stream-aligned teams.
   * **Pros:** Improves productivity, reduces duplication, enforces standards
   * **Cons:** May not be responsive to stream team needs, risk of overbuilding

**Best for:** Organizations focused on delivery flow and optimizing cognitive load.

**Pros:**
* Full ownership reduces handoffs and dependencies
* Faster feedback loops and incident resolution
* Aligns incentives (build it, run it)
* Reduces "throw it over the wall" mentality

**Cons:**
* Requires broad skill sets from team members
* On-call responsibilities can lead to burnout
* Difficult to maintain deep expertise in all areas
* Security and compliance may be challenging

**Best for:** Digital-native companies with emphasis on operational excellence and rapid iteration.

### Organizational Evolution

Most organizations evolve through different structures as they grow:

1. **Startup (1-10 engineers):** Usually generalists with fluid responsibilities
2. **Early Growth (10-30 engineers):** Emerging specialization, often organized by features
3. **Scale-up (30-100 engineers):** More formal structure, often transitioning to some form of matrix
4. **Enterprise (100+ engineers):** Complex structures with multiple organizing principles

### Considerations When Choosing a Structure

* **Company stage and growth trajectory**
* **Product complexity and technical requirements**
* **Team size, locations, and time zones**
* **Delivery cadence requirements**
* **Regulatory or compliance constraints**
* **Existing culture and team preferences**
* **Customer interaction model**

### Transitioning Between Structures

When evolving your organization structure:

1. **Communicate clear rationale** for the change
2. **Involve teams** in planning the transition
3. **Move incrementally** rather than all at once
4. **Expect temporary productivity dips**
5. **Be prepared to adjust** based on feedback
6. **Focus on outcomes** rather than strict adherence to a model

Remember that Conway's Law works both ways - deliberately structure your teams to reflect the architecture and product boundaries you want to create.

## Leveling and Promotions

Ok, this is a can of worms, and a very hot topics. Here is my personal view and experience.
First this is a related to performance review but is putting visible (internal or external) structures around it.

I firmly believe that until the company passes the existential threats (i.e. a runway that is not measured in months) leveling will be just a distraction and a cause of unhappiness among the team. So wait until the pressure to have a leveling system in place as much as you can and focus the team on delivering the product/milestones.

So when you should introduce leveling? Here my personal view:
You introduce leveling for the following reasons:
- You need a formal way for junior engineer to grow inside the company,
- You need a way to unify the performance expectations across the org, and ultimately
- You have a benchmark for external hiring people - so they
What its is not:
- A way to compensate people! yes levels are a floor to the comp but they should be losely coupled.


## Communication and Transparency

- Implement a regular cadence of team-wide and company-wide communications.
- Use tools like Slack, email newsletters, and all-hands meetings to keep everyone informed.
- Encourage open dialogue and create channels for anonymous feedback.
- Share successes, failures, and lessons learned to foster a culture of continuous improvement.

## Continuous Learning and Improvement

- Implement a system for collecting and acting on feedback from team members.
- Regularly review and update processes based on team input and changing needs.
- Encourage experimentation and innovation, allowing for controlled failures as learning opportunities.
- Share knowledge through internal tech talks, blog posts, or documentation.

## Work-Life Balance and Well-being

- Promote a healthy work-life balance by setting a good example as a manager.
- Implement policies that support flexible working hours and locations.
- Encourage the use of vacation time and respect off-hours.
- Provide resources for mental health and stress management.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

- Develop and implement strategies to increase diversity in hiring and promotion.
- Create an inclusive environment where all team members feel valued and heard.
- Provide training on unconscious bias and inclusive leadership.
- Regularly assess and address any pay equity issues.

## Tech Lead-Manager Relationship

Do not prioritize tech items before people management. Rely on the tech lead to own all the tech soundness, they are responsible for the technical execution\!

* tech lead owns **how things are developed**  
* manager owns the **who develops things**  
* both shared is the **when the things are shipped**  
* Tools:  
  * daily sync up (sync or async) and daily linear board review\!
