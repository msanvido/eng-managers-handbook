# People Management

{: .note-title }
> Personal Note
> * People management goes further than company needs. People will come and leave the company,
> but will always remember how they have been managed. Remember that one day they might even
> hire you — or more likely asked for a backdoor reference.  
> * You cannot make everybody happy\! This is probably the hardest part of the manager's job,
> but do not optimize on maximizing people's happiness, maximize for outcomes.  
> * You mostly will hear negative feedback, and sometimes it is hard to stay positive.
> Remember you are the cheerleader for the org, people look at you for how you respond to negative
> feedback. If you find the negativity overwhelming work with your leader/HR team to address the negativity.

## Goals

Your most important goal is to set up each engineer for success and have maximal impact to the team and company.
So it is very important you clearly align with the team and engineer on what the goals are.

Now let the magic happen, you hired smart people and let them do what they are best at! Now is the time to monitor and be proactive. 

Like you monitor software systems you need to keep an eye on how things are progressing, and scale things up and down based as needed, etc.

Here a short list of things you could do:

* Distribute workload to the team members evenly and based on know-how, capabilities, and interests of the engineer.  
* Give growth opportunities (e.g. lead a project, pair with a senior eng to accelerate their progress, organize training and lunch & learns, etc)  
* Monitor engineering performance (contributions) and change/assign workload accordingly  
* Monitor/Approve vacation/WFH/WFR: This is not to be a spy but you are responsible for you employees and hence you should know where they are:  
  * Important for planning purposes  
  * In case of emergencies (accidents, earthquakes, etc)  
  * In case of urgent requests (customer requests)  
* Support the need of each engineer: Different types of engineers need different support (4 types: insecure, knowledgeable, bored, disengaged)

## Building a Strength Map
Like you do when driving somewhere you need a map and a directions how to get there.
Similarly when you are responsible for a team and product you need to know where you are going and how to get there.
This should be your starting point, and likely the first thing you do when you join a team. Understand you team capabilities: who would be very hard to do any planning (both projects, and people)

What is a strength and weaknesses map for each individual engineer and collaborator:
- What is this engineers strength
- What is the know-how and level of expertise 
- What are the weaknesses and areas of improvement
- And ultimately how much you can lean on them

This strength map is going to help you both in assign projects, teams as well as a starting point for performance reviews.
Note that this is you opinion and you should continuously validate and confirm the strength map with your with external sources (either on 1:1, or skip-levels or even with people outside of the company)

## Building Relationships and Team Dynamics

People are not Machines hence building a personal relationships is vital to create a high performing environment.
Is important to know what’s going on in their personal lives as well: In my experience this can only be learned by building a good personal relationship with each employee.

Interpersonal dynamics with other teammates or customers: listen/watch carefully to how people interact. This is very difficult to do in a remote setting.  

## Balancing Workload

- Assign tasks based on team member's strengths and interests.
- Monitor and adjust workload based on team member's performance.
- Encourage team members to take on additional responsibilities.
- Try to create team continuity in projects, there is a non-trivial cost in context-switching.

Energizing and de-energizing work: unfortunately there is some work that needs to be done that might be found de-energizing to some. Important is to balance is and distribute the de-energizing work across the team in a fair way. Some people might not be vocal about it, hence is important to monitor the individual energy and productivity. Sadly the squeaky wheel is usually getting the grease, and is your role to make sure that all the deserving wheels get the grease.

## Fostering a Growth Mindset

Encourage continuous learning and development within your team:

- Set up mentorship programs pairing junior and senior engineers.
- Allocate time and budget for learning and development activities.
- Celebrate learning achievements and knowledge sharing (Lunch and Learns, or external speakers series, etc)
- Setup a learning budget for your team.
- Conference attendance: this is usually seen as a reward so be sure to reward the right people.

## Managing Remote and Distributed Teams

As remote work becomes more common, consider these additional points:

- Establish clear communication channels and expectations for remote work.
- Use tools to facilitate virtual collaboration (e.g., Miro, Figma, Notion).
- Schedule regular virtual team-building activities to maintain team cohesion.
- Be mindful of time zones when scheduling meetings and setting deadlines.

## Team dynamics, cohesion, and inclusion:

* Create an environment where everybody feels part of the team and shares wins and losses (think sport’s team spirit). Foster collaboration: Competition across teams and team members might be fun but not healthy in the long run; **PLEASE foster collaboration instead**.  
* Monitor for “alpha” and “silent” engineers. Make sure everybody can share views, and nobody abuses them. Let the senior engineers speak last, always ask for input both in public and in private.  
* praise in public and in person, BUT criticize in private unless you want to make a point to the whole team.  
* **ZERO-TOLERANCE for any unacceptable behaviors (see** [company code of conduct](https://app.vanta.com/policies/code-of-conduct-bsi))\!: If we let any unacceptable behavior slide, it will set the bar for the whole company. Quickly react, stop it, and make sure people know you intervened and make sure you chain of management and HR are aware of it and decide any next steps (warnings, suspension, termination)  
* praise/highlight good behavior and lead by example


> Note that one trap of the servant leadership style is that there is a tendency to step in to help when needed. You should not take over and fix the issue but rather help fix the issue: i.e. avoid the “don’t worry I’ll take care of it”

## Tools at your disposition

* Monitor (how you know how people are doing)  
  * Weekly sync-up with each engineer (see suggestions on how to structure 1:1)  
  * monitor PR review/scanning (see script to scrap PR from github)  
  * monitor commits (git-flame or similar tools)  
  * monitor linear/jira tickets completion (\#closed, speed of closing and creation)

  Remember as a manager these are no**t metrics you want to track** (e.g. n number of tickets close per spring) but only the “logs” helping you debug potential issues. If you track these metrics you set the incentives wrong, you care only about impact and that is not measured by the number of commits.

* Control: These are the tools at your disposition to make changes  
  * 1:1 Feedback (how to give feedback.. See radical candor, sandwich approach) but if you build trust and transparency with your reports it is much easier…   
  * Workload/deliverable assignments: Add more, remove work, make sure to assign tasks that can be accomplished: balance energizing vs de-energizing work. Be fair across the team and teams and avoid creating the “go-to-guy” syndrome.  
  * Non-tech assignments: these are mostly interrupts like customer support, doc-writing, etc.  
  * Suggest special day-off(s): if you notice burndown and somethings is not right (personal situations)  
  * Leave of absence (See HR regulations): for issues that linger for a while this is a good option.   
  * Vacation/Day offs (see company guidelines): Make sure they do not impact the wider team, and have a backup plan for critical components.  
  * Performance reviews (should be done regularly)  
    * Self-assessments, manager assessment, OKRs, and eng org raking  
    * Area leads feedback  
  * OKRs (or a way to highlight the company and team goals)  
    * Ideally quarterly: format TBD based on the new teams  
  * For new hires: create a 30-60-90 plan to help you and the new hire bootstrap inside the company (have a standard our 30-60-90 day plans format)  
  * Performance Bonuses / Spot Bonuses / Gifts for people that for above the call of duty (You need to setup a quarterly/yearly budget org-wide for this: prepare it ahead of time so you have it ready)  
  * Team events:  
    * Have a team budget (e.g. $100/Q/person) manager by the teams (for team dinners or swag… let the team decide how to allocate it)  
  * Reassignments (move to another team):  
    * sometimes people skill, or personal issues are better if we move people in inter teams  
  * Performance Improvement Plan (PIP): Last resort to get somebody back on track.  
    * You must be OK with **any** outcome  
    * It will impact your relationship moving forward.  
    * Setup clear expectation and outcomes  
    * Work with HR/team-lead to correctly put this plan in place  
    * Some companies do not believe in PIPs, and prefer to be direct and move to a separation. Personally I think PIPs are important not only for the employee but as a signal that the company cares about making people successful and did everything possible before moving to a separation. I have seen 80% failures (i.e. PIP did not work), but the 20% of successes created very loyal and improved employees.  
  * Separation  
    * This is the last resort\! There is no way back, and the blast radius’s moral impact is also to be considered.  
    * Make sure to manage the communication on the way out and don’t delegate the termination to HR.  
    * Make sure team members are also aware and have 1:1 with them during (or just after the separation)  
    * Employees should not be surprised, they should know they are not performing at the expected level and might be on their way out.  
  * Leveling and promotions:  
    * Startup and levels is a long discussion, leverage one of the many levels in the industry and “adapt” it for your company needs. Don’t build one just for your company… This is a tool you will need/use externally as well.  
    * When introducing levels? Honestly the later the better BUT it will come up: especially junior engineers will want a level to measure themselves against the senior engineers. Also if you have none and introduce one… be prepared for some unhappiness in the org.  
    * Make sure you have a fixed cadence for re-evaluate people's performances, comp and their contribution (See template on how to run a performance review)

## Attrition

* Regrettable: this is the worst… mgmt’s goal is to avoid this:  
  * Can we match the offer? Often this is a temporary solution since money is often not the root cause.  
* Non-regrettable: these are people we “gently” pushed out.  
  * Best solution for all (no blast radius); make sure it is amicable and well communicated to the team members.  
  * Be in control of the narrative.

Startup attrition and tenure at startups is likely in the 2-3 years range (need some more data), but startups that are doing well and growing are more in the 5-7 years. 

Note: Startup years are a bit like dog-years in corporate life: 1 year at a startup can feel like 7 years at a larger company since things move way faster and at an accelerated pace.
