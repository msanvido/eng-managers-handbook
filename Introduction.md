# Introduction

I wrote this guide over the past years as an accumulation of experiences and notes mostly learned while working at startups just starting to grow (0-50 engineers).
It was originally tailored especially to new first-line managers - people who had never managed a team or newly hired managers joining the team. My biggest goal was to establish a coherent and unified management style across teams at a company, which is crucial for reducing chaos in the early stages of a startup and facilitating team mobility.

This guide can be thought of as a checklist of things a manager will be responsible for, and a reference for the tools available to you. It is not meant to be a set of rules to blindly follow; true leadership must be natural and heartfelt, meaning adapt this handbook to your own style and what works best for the team and the company at that particular time and moment.

Remember that this handbook is a living document. As your organization grows and evolves, you should adapt these principles and practices accordingly. Embrace change and continuously strive for improvement. For example feel free to fork this handbook and adapt it to your org specific needs.
